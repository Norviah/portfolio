We've all seen it: Git histories where commit messages are simply just "fixed
thing", "updated thing", random text, or even just `.`, at one point or another,
we're all guilty of it. The issue with this "naming scheme" is that in the
future, you may forget what you were doing, or someone else may need to look at
your repository but is unable to get a high-level understanding from the commit
history, which brings another set of problems as they'll have to read the code
but is then dependent on whether if the code is well documented, structured,
etc.

Documentation is applicable to various aspects of a developer lifecyle, from
variable names and comments, to READMEs and commit messages, good and clear
documentation is often overlooked and ignored while being a very important part
of the development process.

While there are various ways to have good documentation, this article will focus
on writing better commit messages by following the [conventional commit
structure](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) to help
commit messages convey the changes made within the commit.

### What Are Conventional Commits

As specified within the
[documentation](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary),
Conventional Commits is a specification for writing standardized commit
messages by following a format to convey the changes made within the commit.

```text
<type>([scope]): <description>

[body]

[footer(s)]
```

Each part of the format has a specific purpose to convey what changes were made:

- **type** (required): The type of change that was made, this value should be a
  noun to describe the change. There are no strict list of types to choose from,
  you can use any string you feel is best, however, some examples are: `feat`
  for new features, `fix` for bug fixes, `docs` for documentation changes, etc.
- **scope** (optional): An optional value you can specify to further categorize
  the change, often being the section of the codebase that was changed.
- **description** (required): A short description of the change.
- **body** (optional): A longer description describing the change
  in more detail, must be separated from the description by a blank line.
- **footer** (optional): A footer section that can be used to reference issues
  or pull requests that are associated with the commit, each footer must be
  on a newline and must consist of a word followed by either `:[space]` or
  `[space]#`, followed by a string value.

### Why Should We Use Conventional Commits?

There are two main benefits of using conventional commits: readability and
automation.

Following this structure makes commit messages easily convey the goal of the
respective commit, making it easier for everyone (including your future self) to
understand the changes made and where they were made. The format also brings
consistency to the commit history, allowing for other functionality, such as
automation.

Beyond clarifying commit messages, the format allows tools to be built on top of
commit messages, most notably, changelogs. The consistent commit history allows
tools to read and generate changelogs, as an example, the [changelog for the
repository of this
website](https://github.com/Norviah/portfolio/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) is
generated by using [bump](https://github.com/Norviah/bump), a tool I created to
generate changelogs from conventional commits.

### Examples

For example, let's say you:

- added a new feature to send an email to the customer when a product is shipped:

```text
feat(api): send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
```

- fixed a bug:

```text
fix: fix a bug that caused a crash when users uploads a photo for their profile

closes: https://github.com/user/repo/issues/1
```

- update dependencies:

```text
chore(deps): update `[package]` to `[version]`
```

- changed the color for the foreground text of the application's dark theme:

```text
style(theme): change the dark theme's foreground color to `[color]`
```
