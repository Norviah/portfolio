We've all seen it: git histories where the commit messages are simply just "fixed
thing", "updated thing", something random, or even just `.`, at one point or
another we're all guilty of it. The issue with this naming scheme is that in the
future you may forget what you were doing, or someone else may need to look at
your repo but is unable to get a high-level understanding from the commit
messages, meaning they'll have to read the code which brings another set of
problems such as whether if it's well documented, structured, etc. 

Documentation is applicable to various aspects of a developer lifecycle, from
comments, to READMEs, to commit messages, good and clear documentation is often
overlooked and ignored while being a very important part of the development
process. Implementing good documentation practices is a skill that can help you
and others in the long run.

While there are various ways to have good documentation, this post will focus on
writing bettter commit messages and how following the [Conventional Commit
structure](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) can help
commit messages portray the changes made within the commit.

### What Are Conventional Commits?

Conventional commits, or semantic commit messages, are commit messages that
follow a specific format to help convey the changes made within the commit. The
format is as follows:

```text
<type>([scope]): <description>
```

Each part of the commit has a specific purpose to convey what changes were made:

- **type**: The type of change that was made.
- **scope**: An optional value you can use to further categorize the change.
- **description**: A short description of the change made.

To further describe the `type` value, there are no strict list of types to
choose from, you can use any string you feel is best. Some common types are:

- **feat**: Represents a new feature,
- **fix**: Represents a bug fix,
- **docs**: Represents documentation changes,
- **style**: Represents changes that do not affect the code, such as
  formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.

To take an example from the documentation, here is an example of this structure:

```text
feat(api): send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
```

- **type**: Here we can see that the type is `feat`, so we know that the commit
  added a new feature.
- **scope**: The message also implemented the scope value, which is `api`, so we
  also know that the commit added a new feature relevant to the project's API.
- **description**: Here, the commit states that the added feature is to send an
  email to the customer when a product is shipped.

From this example, we can easily read the commit message and understand what it
does.

### Why Should We Use Conventional Commits?

For a simple change on how commit messages are written, we can present useful
information on what changes were made and where they were made.

Another benefit of using this format is that it can be used to automate tools on
top of it, most notably, changelogs. For example, the [changelog for this
repo](https://github.com/Norviah/portfolio/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) is
generated by using [bump](https://github.com/Norviah/bump), a tool I created to
generate changelogs from conventional commits.
